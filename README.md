## Getting Started

Hey guys! We're building an app to manage stuff that happens at Kannada Circle of Acting at RV College of Engineering. If you're interested to contribute to this repo, feel free to fork it. I'll only accept pull requests from my teammates and KCARV members :), but hey you can take a look at the code.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
